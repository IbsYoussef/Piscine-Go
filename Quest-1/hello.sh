#!/bin/sh
# Exercise: introduction
#
# Required:
# After configuring your credentials and creating/cloning the 'piscine-go' repo,
# create a script named 'hello.sh' that prints 'Hello <username>!' 
# where <username> is your own username.
#
# Placeholder:
# Replace "<username>" with your actual username before running the script.
#
# Explanation:
# At the time this file was created/run, my username was '<username>',
# so the simple example below prints that exact greeting. 
# Replace it with your username, or modify the script to accept an argument if you prefer.
#
# Command explanation:
# - echo: prints its arguments to standard output followed by a newline.
#         Here, it prints the greeting exactly as required by the exercise.

echo "Hello <username>!"

# Example with my username:
echo "Hello iyoussef!"
#
# Example usage:
# $ bash hello.sh
# Hello iyoussef!
#
# Notes:
# - Ensure your script file is executable (run 'chmod +x hello.sh' if needed).
# - When submitted, this script should output your greeting exactly as shown.
# - This was the first exercise in the Piscine-Go selection pool, 
#   marking the setup of your Git repository and initial commit.
