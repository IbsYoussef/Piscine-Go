**Status:** Optional

## Problem Statement

Create a file named `my_answer.sh` that solves a command-line murder mystery by investigating files in the [the-final-cl-test](https://github.com/01-edu/the-final-cl-test) repository. The script must output only the murderer's full name.

## Expected Output Format
```
Joe Germuska
```

(One line: the murderer's full name)

## Requirements

- Clone and investigate the mystery repository
- Use command-line tools to gather clues
- Output ONLY the murderer's full name (one line)
- No additional text or formatting

## How to Work on This

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/01-edu/the-final-cl-test.git`
2. Write your solution in `student/my_answer.sh`
3. Run `./run.sh` to see your output
4. Run `./test.sh` to check if it works
5. Compare with `solutions/my_answer.sh` if you need help

## Hints

- Start by examining the `crimescene` file
- Look for marked CLUEs
- Cross-reference membership lists
- Follow witness leads (Annabel)
- Check vehicle registrations
- Use tools like `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, and `comm`
